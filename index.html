      <p>New York City Council Member Vanessa Gibson continues to wag war on crime and violence in the Bronx. Less than a year ago, Gibson spearheaded the ‘mobile trauma unit’, and within a short period of time, mobile trauma units are becoming a
        staple in the Bronx communities that matter most. Gibson alongside Bronx District Attorney Darcel Clark as well as members of the organization BronxConnect showcased two mobile trauma units serving the section of Claremont Village.</p>

        <figcaption>“This is our effort to focus on a holistic and therapeutic response to gun violence,” Gibson said. “It is based on a Chicago model that looks at how communities are underinvested and what they lack as a root cause to why young
          people engage in violence in the first place. Years ago, back in 2011, we started out in five neighborhoods based on police precincts with the highest concentration of violence. We then poured a lot of money into these areas specific areas.
          We focus on mental health, health care, school services, education, therapeutic services and hospital responders. It was a collaborative effort that focused on a catchment area, which is part of a precinct."</figcaption>

      <p>The mobile trauma units are all one level vans, staffed with social workers and trauma unit therapists as well. Mobile unit personnel intends to provide the families of homicide victims, as well as other sufferers of violent crimes with the
        proper emotional and psychological support needed.</p>

      <p> Not to be confused, all mobile trauma units will provide services to members from other jurisdictions. Individuals from different communities also have the option of traveling to different mobile units depending on the severity of the
        emergency. The mobile trauma unit can and will travel to high need areas. Discretion will be utilized and considered on a case-by-case basis.

        “It depends where the unit is. It’s always going to be open to whoever comes up to them,” Bronx D.A. Clark said. “So, they are not going to turn somebody away. ‘Where do you live? Oh, I am sorry we are not in your...’So that’s not going to
        happen.”

      </p>This concerted effort to help communities ravaged by grief is a resource that many elected officials hope is utilized. This should be taken advantage of.

        <p> Based on the findings on the map, more mobile trauma units should be housed in the communities of Concourse Village, Mott Haven and Crotona Park.</p>
